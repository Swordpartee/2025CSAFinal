• Create a dungeon fighter
    - weapons like swords, bow and arrows, etc.
    - defensive options like shields, armor, and magic

• Upgradable abilities
    - each win or loss gives a new power-up or upgrade
    - different stats like strength, agility, and mana

• Local servers for pvp
    - server rooms with passwords and custom accounts
    - encryption
    - low (enough) latency for active and responsive combat

• Replayability
    - custom accounts have stats like level and nametags
    - customizable costumes and hats (hopefully)
